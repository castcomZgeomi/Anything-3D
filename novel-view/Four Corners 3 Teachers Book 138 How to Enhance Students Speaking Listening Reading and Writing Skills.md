# Review of Four Corners Level 3 Teacher's Edition with Assessment Audio CD/CD-ROM
 
Four Corners is an integrated four-skills English course for adults and young adults. The Level 3 Teacher's Edition with Assessment Audio CD/CD-ROM features complete teaching instructions, optional activities, photocopiable video activity sheets, video teaching notes, audio and video scripts, language summaries, and Student Book and Workbook answer keys. The Assessment CD-ROM provides a complete assessment program, including oral and written quizzes, as well as unit tests in printable PDF and Microsoft WordÂ® formats.
 
In this review, I will focus on page 138 of the Teacher's Edition, which corresponds to Unit 9 Lesson B of the Student Book. The lesson topic is "Extreme sports" and the grammar focus is "Gerunds and infinitives". The lesson objectives are to enable students to talk about extreme sports and why people do them, and to use gerunds and infinitives correctly.

The lesson begins with a warm-up activity that asks students to look at photos of different extreme sports and identify them. Then, students listen to a conversation between two friends who are talking about extreme sports. The listening task checks students' comprehension of the main ideas and details of the conversation. Next, students practice the pronunciation of gerunds and infinitives in sentences. After that, students study the grammar box that explains the rules and exceptions for using gerunds and infinitives after certain verbs. Students then do a controlled practice exercise that requires them to complete sentences with gerunds or infinitives. Finally, students do a freer practice activity that involves asking and answering questions about extreme sports using gerunds and infinitives.
 
The lesson ends with a wrap-up activity that reviews the vocabulary and grammar of the lesson. Students work in pairs to take turns describing an extreme sport using three words or phrases. Their partner has to guess which sport it is.
 
Overall, I think this is a well-designed lesson that covers the four skills of listening, speaking, reading, and writing. The activities are engaging, interactive, and communicative. The lesson provides clear explanations and examples of the grammar point, as well as ample practice opportunities. The lesson also exposes students to a variety of vocabulary related to extreme sports. The lesson is suitable for intermediate-level students who want to improve their English skills and learn about different cultures and topics.
  
One of the strengths of this book is that it includes a variety of supplementary materials that enhance the teaching and learning experience. The Assessment Audio CD/CD-ROM contains listening and speaking tests for each unit, as well as mid-term and final tests that assess all four skills. The tests are easy to administer and score, and they provide useful feedback on students' progress and performance. The CD-ROM also contains editable versions of the tests that allow teachers to customize them according to their needs and preferences.
 
Another useful feature of this book is that it offers optional activities for each lesson that can be used to extend, review, or recycle the language and skills of the lesson. These activities include games, role plays, surveys, discussions, and writing tasks. They are designed to motivate students and make learning fun and meaningful. They also cater to different learning styles and preferences.
 
In conclusion, I highly recommend this book to teachers and students who are looking for a comprehensive and engaging English course that covers all four skills and a wide range of topics. The book provides clear and effective teaching instructions, as well as a variety of assessment and optional activities that can be adapted to different contexts and situations. The book is suitable for intermediate-level students who want to improve their English skills and learn about different cultures and topics.
